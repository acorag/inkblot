					<h1> Inkblot</h1>

					<h3>A website for stories</h3>

					<p class="txtBgPeriwinkle">
						<img src="img/img-pinky00.png" class="img-pinky" alt=""  />
						...yea and I totally paint- oh hey there.
						Can I, like, help you or something?
					</p>
					
					<p class="txtBgPink">
						Oh, no, Inky's not here, man. I'm Pinky.
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgPeriwinkle">
						You want to look around? Sure, it's totally cool.
						Most of the construction is all done.
						Sorry there isn't a lot of content; we only recently
						finished rebuilding the place but all the furniture
						and decorations have been ordered.
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgPink">
						What happened to Inky? Bro, crazy story!
						Okay, so, like, I guess the
						construction was totally finished and the boss came in
						and was like "I don't like any of it, tear it all down
						and start over!"
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgPeriwinkle">
						I know, right? The workers were totally steamed 
						because they worked
						really hard to make everything perfect and stuff. So 
						all at once, all the workers started to riot. They destroyed
						everything. I got really scared and I locked myself in the
						library. Kinda lucky I guess, because that was, like,
						the only room with any content in it. 
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgPink">
						So I guess I kinda
						saved the day. Then the rioting stopped as suddenly as it
						started. It went from a deafening roar one second, to
						crickets the next. After it went silent,
						I waited for a few minutes and when I
						looked outside they were all gone. I guess most
						of them just, like, walked out. 
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgPeriwinkle">
						Yea, just like that. They all just left. Crazy, right?
						The entire place was completely destroyed. There was nothing
						left except the empty bookshelves in the library and I found
						a paintbrush, but everything else - gone.
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgPink">
						So the boss found out and I thought for sure
						he would get, like,
						totally ticked, but he didn't. He walked in like
						nothing happened and when he saw me - he shrugged.
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgPeriwinkle">
						Then all of a sudden, the boss just started doing all 
						the repairs by himself. He was working like a madman. 
						I've  never seen anything like it. He built that
						menu up there with all kinds of, like, mechanical gizmo
						things and he rebuilt all the pages with some 
						flexible rubbery stuff. Yep, and he painted the entire 
						place pink. So random, right?
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgPink">
						You won't hear me complaining dude, I feel right at 
						home now. If work gets too crazy, I just like, fade 
						into the background. It's pretty far out, man.
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgPeriwinkle">
						Dude! This was mostly the boss, but I totally helped too. 
						I painted the website name on the
						 banner up there. It looks pretty awesome.
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgPink">
						Oh, don't let me hold you up. Go ahead and explore man.
						Sorry there isn't much decoration here. Most of
						the work was put into the design and once that was
						finished, the boss just kinda crashed. Well,
						if you need me, I will be right here... maybe... 
						or maybe not... if ya know what I mean.
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgPeriwinkle">
						What's that? Oh, Inky? Sorry, I, like, lost my train of
						thought trying to explain everything. I guess I just don't
						really want to think about...
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgPink">
						Is she alive? Of course, she is working in the Inspiration
						room. Why would you ask that?
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgPeriwinkle">
						Okay, well I'm gonna go now.
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgPink">
						Oh, hey, if you find any, like, Lorem or Ipsum anywhere, can you
						toss it out for me? Thanks man.
