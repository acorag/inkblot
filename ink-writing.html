					<h1> WRITING </h1>

					<h2>Your story begins here...</h2>

					<p class="txtBgPink">
						The exciting first step!
						Hey, don't worry if this page looks too serious -
						don't be fooled. There is plenty of silliness
						to be found here.
					</p>
					
					<h4>...and it starts with me!</h4>

					<p class="txtBgPeriwinkle">
						You should also consider the source
						of the information here. I do not
						have any qualifications to teach writing, and I have never
						published anything; I am just a person that enjoys
						reading and occasionally likes to write stuff.
						Information here has no sources and no references.
						It is all based on my opinion and experience;
						so take all of this content with a molecule of halite.
					</p>

					<h4>Assumptions about you...</h4>

					<p class="txtBgPink">
						It seems like a good idea to mention that there is no
						"best way" to write a story. If your name happens to
						rhyme with a random word combination like "Steven King"
						and you can vomit a story
						when your powers of paper, pen, and chair 
						are combined, then this section is probably not for you.
						So why are you here? Get back to writing!
					</p>

					<h4>And then another dot, dot...</h4>

					<p class="txtBgPeriwinkle">
						For the rest of us literary mortals
						that don't sell books by the pound
						(about half a kg for all you metric fans),
						writing can be a lot of fun - and
						the fun starts with
						an outline. You can make life easy and build your
						outline by asking and answering a series of questions.
						It is like a Spanish Inquisition game...
						minus all the fear and torture. Plus, you can
						actually expect this game; and
						you get to live through it even if you
						change your answers later. What a fun game!
					</p>

					<h3>Outline help: Start Small</h3>

					<p class="txtBgPink">
						I know. Even starting a simple outline
						can feel simply daunting... but using a simple chart
						(like the simple chart below) can simplify the creation of
						your simple outline, because it asks
						simple questions about your simp- er... unwritten story.
						<br /><br />
						Simple!
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgPeriwinkle">
						It is okay to start with a one word answer.
						You can expound on that word later. You can also
						use multiple answers. You have complete
						creative control.
					</p>

					<h3>6 Questions</h3>

					<p class="txtBgPeriwinkle">
						That is to say, "who?" "what?" "when?" "where?" "why?" and
						after all of those questions have been answered, you
						can go back and fill in the periodic "how?s." You have
						probably realized by now that my favorite writing tools
						are questions. For example, why is the chart header silver
						and orange on this pink website? That is a good question.
						The answer? Because.
					</p>

					<h3>Who?</h3>

					<p class="txtBgPink">
						Develop your characters! Write 
						your story about a person or humanize a place, thing, or idea.
						Examples would be a point of view of a town, a shoe, or an emotion.
						Writing from the point of view of an object was popularized
						back in the 1800s and is actually Inky's favorite writing style.
					</p>

					<h3>What?</h3>

					<p class="txtBgPeriwinkle">
						I once read somewhere that George Lucas
						wrote Star Wars because he wanted to write a space opera. So
						the first question he asked was "where."
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgPink">
						At some point you will have to define what happens
						in your story. Sometimes you can answer this question last
						once you know the when, where, and who. But the bulk of your
						story is going to be answered here, so this question weighs
						a lot more than any other question, but it is admittedly
						one of the most ambiguous.
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgPeriwinkle">
						The "what" answer is going to be an event. In sequence, or individualized,
						events will move your story forward - or back if it is about
						time travel. Events can be unique to each
						character or they can be shared. I have noticed a trend
						of enjoyable stories where an event or a series of events
						link unconnected characters that may not necessarily ever meet.
						This concept adds depth to your story.
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgPink">
						A useful tactic is to create a chart that connects
						characters to an event. So at the time of the event,
						record in the chart each character's name, location, and what they
						were doing at the moment of the event. Are you getting
						some writing ideas already? Me too! Isn't this exciting!?
					</p>

					<h3>When?</h3>

					<p class="txtBgPeriwinkle">
						Probably one of the easiest questions, because the choices
						are limited to past, present, future. You can pick one, or
						use a combination of all three. This is a crucial question
						for anyone writing an epoch.
					</p>

					<h3>Where?</h3>

					<p class="txtBgPink">
						This question isn't as open ended as "what" but it is probably
						the closest. If you can think of a place, you can write about it.
						A story can take place on a subatomic particle, in the nucleus of
						a cell, or in an alternate reality. It is all up to you!
					</p>

					<h3>Why?</h3>

					<p class="txtBgPeriwinkle">
						Answering this question will give your story
						depth and dimension. Even if you don't directly answer
						why something happened in your story, you can 
						still allude to the answer or imply it. 
						Not directly answering "why"
						is often what keeps people reading. Letting the reader
						decide the answer can sometimes be a rewarding experience.
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgPink">
						As long as you know the answer as to "why"
						before you begin writing, you can write in a way that
						lets the answer bleed through in your writing,
						like ink through paper - slow and frustrating.
						This writing method is very enjoyable to read, in my opinion.
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgPeriwinkle">
						Considering that nature and physics are 
						constant and dependable, answering "why" is easy 
						when writing about reality.
						Venturing into fantasy removes the inhibitions of
						reality, but fantasy still needs its own rules
						for a story to remain interesting - or at least
						comprehensible. So keep that in mind.
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgPink">
						This is the point where questions are required to be
						combined in order to write a decent story.
						You will need to answer a "why" question for every
						"what" answer (event) you write into your story.
						This leads to back stories, and prequels, and dramatic,
						emotional scenes. Eventually leading into our next segway...
					</p>

					<h3>How?</h3>
					
					<p class="txtBgPeriwinkle">
						Answering this question is going to provide all the
						dialogue and action in your story. 
						The "how" answers are where you
						write in all the details. This is where the veritable
						rubber meets the road.
					</p>

					<h3>Discussion</h3>
					
					<p class="txtBgPink">
						I guess that is it for our writing intro. If you are still
						awake, I hope reading all of this obvious advice helped
						get you started with your writing project. Happy writing!
