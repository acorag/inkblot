					<h3>Anthony Coragliotti | CIS 155</h3>

					<hr />

					<h4>Version 1 (2019 JAN 18)</h4>

					<p class="txtBgLiteGreen">
						In Version One (V1) of my website, I created three documents: 
						index.html, about.html, and styles.css
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgYella">
						Within the Body element, I added: A Navigation Menu Div 
						elements to be used as containers; assigned class and id names.
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgLiteGreen">
						Comments on Learning Objectives (In order of appearance): 
						M2LO4a, M1LO6, M1LO8, M2LO4b, M1LO12, M1LO7a, M1LO13a, M1LO9, 
						M1LO10, M2LO7, M1LO7b, M2LO3a, M2LO3b, M2LO4c, M1LO13b, and M1LO13c.
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgYella">
						In the CSS file, I added: Styling in four sections: Defaults, 
						Navigation, Misc Containers, and Text.
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgLiteGreen">
						I also added comments on Learning Objectives: 
						M2LO12, M2LO14, M2LO6a, M2LO5a, M2LO5b, M2LO11a, M2LO11b, 
						M2LO15, M2LO13, and M2LO6b.
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgYella">
						CSS Navigation styles impact: Safely confined within it's own 
						container. Set menu background color to dark blue. Centered and 
						spaced. Hyperlink and text color are set to white. CSS Misc 
						Containers styles impact: The banner is centered at the top. 
						A white center strip contains all text and images on the page.
					</p>

					<hr />

					<h4>Version 2 (2019 FEB 04)</h4>

					<p class="txtBgLiteGreen">
						In Version Two (V2) of my website, I created three more 
						documents: ink-stories.html, ink-writing.html, and ink-inspiration.html
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgYella">
						I completely revamped my page structure. I created 4 
						wireframes and went with the one I liked the best. 
						The wireframe was a really helpful way to get things started.
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgLiteGreen">
						I fixed the issues I had in V1 and made note of them at 
						the top of index.html.
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgYella">
						Content sources:
						The splatter graphic in the banner was obtained from
						http://clipart-library.com/clipart/2054530.htm
						The lettering in the banner is a Microsoft Corp font named "Segoe Print".
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgLiteGreen">
						The fancy cursive font used as images is a Microsoft Corp 
						font named "Parchment".
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgYella">
						The fancy splatter font on the home page is a font from: 
						https://www.fontspace.com/david-kerkhoff/windshield-massacre 
						font name: Windshield Massacre	Author: David Kerkhoff 2011
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgLiteGreen">
						The background image is from:
						http://www.techpresentations.org/ks/splatter-wallpaper/#wopen_splatter-wallpaper_288493.jpg
						Everything else was drawn by me using photoshop or MS paint.
						CSS impact: The CSS in version 2 completely dominated my project.
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgYella">
						CSS changed my page structure and required a new layout, 
						specifically due to the addition of the float ability.
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgLiteGreen">
						CSS gradient was a nice aesthetic addition I really enjoyed 
						learning about and adding to my page.
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgYella">
						It isn't CSS; but I also really enjoyed adding the area map.
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgLiteGreen">
						Learned my lesson from V1 and ran a spell check (glad I did). 
						I feel comfortable with my learning progress. I think the level 
						I want to be at is only a matter of practice. I am pretty happy 
						with my V2 project. It was a lot of work, but it was a lot of fun.
					</p>

					<hr />

					<h4>Version 3 (2019 FEB 17)</h4>

					<p class="txtBgYella">
						In Version Three (V3) of my website, I (once again)
						reconstructed my website from scratch; this time
						to incorporate the new concept of flexboxes.
						I started with a wireframe design that I eventually
						had to abandon as I learned more about using flexboxes and tables.
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgLiteGreen">
						One thing I tried to do differently this version
						was to stay organized and constantly mind my page structure.
						I don't know how successful I was at this, but I drew a
						structure map and forced myself to constantly update it.
						I feel like it helped me to break out of my tunnel-vision
						a little more. I still had to go back and do a lot of
						cleaning up, but at least I knew where everything was.
						I think I even spelled my name right this time.
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgYella">
						Taking on suggestions from the peer review,
						I designed a softer color-scheme (a tribute to Valentine's day)
						that was supposed to be pink, but looks orange on my phone. 
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgLiteGreen">
						I provided support for viewing my website from a 
						variety of different screen sizes. 
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgYella">
						I added a table to my website.
					</p>

					<h5>Source attributions:</h5>

					<p class="txtBgLiteGreen">
						The banner image is from here:<br />
						https://www.goandroid.co.in/40-high-resolution-wallpapers-you-can-download-for-your-smartphones/67879/
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgYella">
						The background calendar image on this about page
						is from here:<br />
						https://stjohnsnorwood.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/calendar.jpg
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgLiteGreen">
						Everything else has already been cited above.
					</p>

					<h5>
						CSS impact:
					</h5>

					<p class="txtBgYella">
						Wireframe. I tried to stick to the wireframe at first
						but, just like the old saying goes: when the going gets tough,
						abandon your wireframe. So that is what I did. I let
						creativity and necessity build my webpage for me. They
						are a benevolent couple.
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgLiteGreen">
						Screens. Adapting to different screen sizes while maintaining
						continuity required a change of layout; which I
						enjoyed doing. 
						I think my website appearance has
						improved because of this adaptability change.
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgYella">
						Flexboxes. Ah, flexboxes. Hmm...
						This is my first introduction to the flexbox and my opinion
						of them is bittersweet. Flexboxes have a lot of features
						I've always hoped to see in CSS, but 
						I found the command syntax to be unintuitive 
						and confusing. As I got more comfortable with using
						flexboxes (lots of practice), I kinda understand
						the name conventions, but I think they could have been
						more... symmetrical.
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgLiteGreen">
						Tables. Tables are pretty straight-forward, I have
						experience with them, but using CSS to style tables was
						a new experience for me. CSS makes table management so
						much easier by applying a single style command 
						to the entire table, instead
						of styling each and every single anatomical
						section. I am glad those days are over. Hurray for CSS!
					</p>

					<hr />

					<h4>Version 4 (2019 MAR 03)</h4>

					<p class="txtBgYella">
						In Version Four (V4) of my website, I drew up a wireframe.
						I embedded a video in an iframe. I animated an image.
						I did my best to make everything sale with the 
						size of the browser.
					</p>

					<p class="txtBgLiteGreen">
						Sadly, I did not provide much content this version,
						but the impact of CSS that I did add was dazzling.
						Animating images, displaying video recordings,
						and styling it all with cusom code.
						CSS has so much more potential than I could have
						imagined.
